\label{cha:data_partitioning}
To validate the results of training various machine learning methods the provided data concerning
the five targets was split into a training-set as well as a test-set. To achieve a 70/30 train/test split ratio each sample was randomly assigned 
to one of the two data partitions\cite[]{Xu2018}.

In order to validate the machine learning approaches during training 10-fold cross-validation has been applied.
For the process of cross-validation the training dataset is split into $n$ equally large subsets.
The type of cross-validation implemented in this thesis uses all but one of these partitions to train the classification model and validates the 
results with the remaining partition. This process is repeated for all possible validation partitions\cite[]{Molinaro2005}.
