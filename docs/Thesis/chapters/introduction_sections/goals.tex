The goals of this thesis are twofold: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate common machine learning approaches for interaction-based activity prediction 
    and compare results with the thesis of Micha Birklbauer\cite[]{Birklbauer2021}.
    \item Evaluate the results posed by various feature engineering techniques and 
    investigate the possible performance benefits for the implemented ML approaches. 
\end{enumerate}

The second goal can be viewed as an extension of the first one since its primary aim is to
improve the results achieved while pursuing the first goal.
