The goals of this thesis are twofold: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate common machine learning approaches for activity prediction 
    and compare results with current literature.
    \item Fine tune the provided datasets using a multitude of feature-engineering practices,
    to increase performance of the ML approaches. 
\end{enumerate}

The second goal can be viewed as an extension of the first one since its primary aim is to
improve the results achieved while pursuing the first goal.
