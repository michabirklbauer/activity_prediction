The goals of this thesis are twofold: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate common machine learning approaches for activity prediction 
    and compare results with current literature.
    \item Evaluate the results posed by various feature engineering techniques and 
    investigate the possible performance benefits for the implemented ML approaches. 
\end{enumerate}

The second goal can be viewed as an extension of the first one since its primary aim is to
improve the results achieved while pursuing the first goal.
