To evaluate different feature engineering approaches the protein \textit{Acetylcholinesterase} was used.
The goal of this evaluation is to determine which feature engineering techniques shall be used on the 
remaining compounds. It is also of interest, which feature engineering techniques work best with each machine learning approach.
