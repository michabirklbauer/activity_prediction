This chapter aims to compare the accumulated results generated in \ref{cha:performance_protein}.
To achieve the desired results the best performing version of each machine learning algorithm has been selected for each protein.
In the following step the average for each of the machine learning algorithms is calculated.
The results of this calculation can be seen in the table below.

            rf   & 0.7762 & 0.1380 & 0.6916 & 2.3596 & 85.8631 \\
            knn  & 0.7352 & 0.2292 & 0.6684 & 1.7419 & 69.6539 \\

In is obvious that the random forest algorithm outperforms the other algorithms. 
RF achieves noticeably better performance across all metrics.
