This thesis serves as a proof of concept for the applicability of machine learning models in combination with feature engineering to predict protein-ligand activity from data of protein docking, as the achieved results 
are more accurate than those achieved using traditional approaches.

However, the machine learning approaches for protein docking where implemented using standard approaches and models. 
Through the use of more problem-tailored algorithmic methods the quality of the results will probably increase. Additionally, only a small sample 
of protein-ligand complexes was researched for this thesis. The machine learning methods proposed within this thesis need to be evaluated on a larger subset of 
protein-ligand compounds to determine how large the benefits of machine learning are for activity prediction from protein docking.
