  abstract     = {IMPORTANCE: The mean cost of developing a new drug has been the subject of debate, with recent estimates ranging from \$314 million to \$2.8 billion. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the research and development investment required to bring a new therapeutic agent to market, using publicly available data. DESIGN AND SETTING: Data were analyzed on new therapeutic agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2009 and 2018 to estimate the research and development expenditure required to bring a new medicine to market. Data were accessed from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Drugs@FDA database, and ClinicalTrials.gov, alongside published data on clinical trial success rates. EXPOSURES: Conduct of preclinical and clinical studies of new therapeutic agents. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Median and mean research and development spending on new therapeutic agents approved by the FDA, capitalized at a real cost of capital rate (the required rate of return for an investor) of 10.5\% per year, with bootstrapped CIs. All amounts were reported in 2018 US dollars. RESULTS: The FDA approved 355 new drugs and biologics over the study period. Research and development expenditures were available for 63 (18\%) products, developed by 47 different companies. After accounting for the costs of failed trials, the median capitalized research and development investment to bring a new drug to market was estimated at \$985.3 million (95\% CI, \$683.6 million-\$1228.9 million), and the mean investment was estimated at \$1335.9 million (95\% CI, \$1042.5 million-\$1637.5 million) in the base case analysis. Median estimates by therapeutic area (for areas with ≥5 drugs) ranged from \$765.9 million (95\% CI, \$323.0 million-\$1473.5 million) for nervous system agents to \$2771.6 million (95\% CI, \$2051.8 million-\$5366.2 million) for antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents. Data were mainly accessible for smaller firms, orphan drugs, products in certain therapeutic areas, first-in-class drugs, therapeutic agents that received accelerated approval, and products approved between 2014 and 2018. Results varied in sensitivity analyses using different estimates of clinical trial success rates, preclinical expenditures, and cost of capital. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides an estimate of research and development costs for new therapeutic agents based on publicly available data. Differences from previous studies may reflect the spectrum of products analyzed, the restricted availability of data in the public domain, and differences in underlying assumptions in the cost calculations.},

  abstract     = {Modern drug discovery is characterized by the production of vast quantities of compounds and the need to examine these huge libraries in short periods of time. The need to store, manage and analyze these rapidly increasing resources has given rise to the field known as computer-aided drug design (CADD). CADD represents computational methods and resources that are used to facilitate the design and discovery of new therapeutic solutions. Digital repositories, containing detailed information on drugs and other useful compounds, are goldmines for the study of chemical reactions capabilities. Design libraries, with the potential to generate molecular variants in their entirety, allow the selection and sampling of chemical compounds with diverse characteristics. Fold recognition, for studying sequence-structure homology between protein sequences and structures, are helpful for inferring binding sites and molecular functions. Virtual screening, the in silico analog of high-throughput screening, offers great promise for systematic evaluation of huge chemical libraries to identify potential lead candidates that can be synthesized and tested. In this article, we present an overview of the most important data sources and computational methods for the discovery of new molecular entities. The workflow of the entire virtual screening campaign is discussed, from data collection through to post-screening analysis.},

  abstract     = {High-throughput screening (HTS) is a well-established process in lead discovery for pharma and biotech companies and is now also being set up for basic and applied research in academia and some research hospitals. Since its first advent in the early to mid-1990s, the field of HTS has seen not only a continuous change in technology and processes but also an adaptation to various needs in lead discovery. HTS has now evolved into a quite mature discipline of modern drug discovery. Whereas in previous years, much emphasis has been put toward a steady increase in capacity (“quantitative increase”) via various strategies in the fields of automation and miniaturization, the past years have seen a steady shift toward higher content and quality (“quality increase”) for these biological test systems. Today, many experts in the field see HTS at the crossroads with the need to decide either toward further increase in throughput or more focus toward relevance of biological data. In this article, the authors describe the development of HTS over the past decade and point out their own ideas for future directions of HTS in biomedical research. They predict that the trend toward further miniaturization will slow down with the implementation of 384-well, 1536-well, and 384 low-volume-well plates. The authors predict that, ultimately, each hit-finding strategy will be much more project related, tailor-made, and better integrated into the broader drug discovery efforts.},

Virtual screening is becoming increasingly popular in the field of drug discovery as in silico techniques are continuously being developed, improved, and made available. As most of these techniques are easy to use, both private and public organizations apply virtual screening methodologies to save resources in the laboratory. However, it is often the case that the techniques implemented in virtual screening workflows are restricted to those that the research team knows. Moreover, although the software is often easy to use, each methodology has a series of drawbacks that should be avoided so that false results or artifacts are not produced. Here, we review the most common methodologies used in virtual screening workflows in order to both introduce the inexperienced researcher to new methodologies and advise the experienced researcher on how to prevent common mistakes and the improper usage of virtual screening methodologies.},

This review provides a comprehensive appraisal of several VS approaches currently available. In the first part of this work, an overview of the recent progress and advances in both ligand-based VS (LBVS) and structure-based VS (SBVS) strategies highlighting current problems and limitations will be provided. Special emphasis will be given to in silico chemogenomics approaches which utilize annotated ligand-target as well as protein-ligand interaction databases and which could predict or reveal promiscuous binding and polypharmacology, the knowledge of which would help medicinal chemists to design more potent clinical candidates with fewer side effects. In the second part, recent case studies (all published in the last two years) will be discussed where the VS technology has been applied successfully. A critical analysis of these case studies provides a good platform in order to estimate the applicability of various VS strategies in the new lead identification and optimization.},

  abstract     = {Molecular docking methodology explores the behavior of small molecules in the binding site of a target protein. As more protein structures are determined experimentally using X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, molecular docking is increasingly used as a tool in drug discovery. Docking against homology-modeled targets also becomes possible for proteins whose structures are not known. With the docking strategies, the druggability of the compounds and their specificity against a particular target can be calculated for further lead optimization processes. Molecular docking programs perform a search algorithm in which the conformation of the ligand is evaluated recursively until the convergence to the minimum energy is reached. Finally, an affinity scoring function, ΔG [U total in kcal/mol], is employed to rank the candidate poses as the sum of the electrostatic and van der Waals energies. The driving forces for these specific interactions in biological systems aim toward complementarities between the shape and electrostatics of the binding site surfaces and the ligand or substrate.},

The reliability of molecular docking depends on the accuracy of the adopted scoring function, which can guide and determine the ligand poses when thousands of possible poses of ligand are generated. The scoring function can be used to determine the binding mode and site of a ligand, predict binding affinity and identify the potential drug leads for a given protein target. Despite intensive research over the years, accurate and rapid prediction of protein–ligand interactions is still a challenge in molecular docking. For this reason, this study reviews four basic types of scoring functions, physics-based, empirical, knowledge-based, and machine learning-based scoring functions, based on an up-to-date classification scheme. We not only discuss the foundations of the four types scoring functions, suitable application areas and shortcomings, but also discuss challenges and potential future study directions.},

Flexibility can be addressed at several levels: implicitly, by smoothing the protein surfaces or allowing some degree of interpenetration (soft docking) or by performing multiple docking runs from various conformations (cross or ensemble docking); or explicitly, by allowing sidechain and/or backbone flexibility. Although significant improvements have been achieved in the modeling of sidechains, methods for the explicit inclusion of backbone flexibility in docking are still being developed. A few novel approaches have emerged involving collective degrees of motion, multicopy representations and multibody docking, which should allow larger conformational changes to be modeled.},
